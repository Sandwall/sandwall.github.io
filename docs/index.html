                    My name is <i>Arav Sanwal</i>, I'm a 3rd-year undergraduate student at 
                    <i>Rutgers University,</i> majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> and 
                    <b>Mathematics</b>, and minoring in <b>Economics</b>.

                    I love building software that is interesting to myself and other people,
                    and as a musician that writes/produces original songs, music technology
                    like synthesizers and effects fit into this category pretty neatly.

                    As someone who writes/produces music and enjoys retro games, I wanted to
                    have the ability to utilize the sound of old video game console hardware
                    whilst writing songs, and so this project seemed like the perfect first VST
                    plugin to build. Put audio through it, and it comes out sounding like it
                    was played straight out of an old SNES console.
